--fuzzyhh.c : May want to add code in beginning of main() to select the
	correct value of elementSize to pass to reservoir_init.
	The issue is that this will either require that the user tells us the
	input dimensionality or the types or something...
	For now, since we're assuming that we're just reading a stream o
	floats, it doesn't matter.
