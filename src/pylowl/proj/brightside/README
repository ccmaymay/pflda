"brightside" is a codebase implementing online variational inference
for forest-structured (Bayesian nonparametric) topic models.  It also
contains some utilities concerning geo-tagged Twitter data, ALNC, and
Freebase.

Currently only one observational model, M0, is implemented.  M0 is
the nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) topic model from the
literature.[1]

The inference code is based on onlinehdp[2], which was in turn based on
onlinelda[3], according to comments in the onlinehdp source.

Dependencies (in addition to pylowl dependencies):
* numpy and scipy
* d3, for visualization (see note below)
* python-concrete and python-thrift, if you want to read and/or write
  concrete data
* nose, if you want to run unit tests

The master branch includes a copy of d3 under postproc/ .  The min
branch is identical to master, at the time of writing, except that d3
has been removed.

To get up and running quickly, run demo.sh from the current directory
(the brightside project directory):

$ bash demo.sh

demo.sh has a few comments---I suggest reading it.  At a high level, it
builds littleowl with brightside, creates a toy concrete dataset from
the source tree, runs M0 for a minute, and does all postprocessing
needed for visualization.  When it's done, all that stands between you
and an underwhelming topic tree is a web server.

demo.sh should have all the steps you need to get going on real data.
Note that concrete support is built in now, but you do need to
extract a vocabulary mapping beforehand.  (This is demonstrated in
demo.sh.  The zeroes are indices for section segmentation, sentence
segmentation, and tokenization list.)  Also, we assume the data has
already been divided into training and testing sets, and that all
preprocessing has been performed.

You can see command-line arguments for learning parameters, etc. with:
$ python -m pylowl.proj.brightside.run -h
(from the repository root, after doing:
$ export PYTHONPATH="build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7:$PYTHONPATH"
or something similar)

The data specifications are glob patterns so you'll end up doing
something like:
$ python -m pylowl.proj.brightside.run \
    --data_path='/path/to/nested/data/*/*' \
    --test_data_path='/path/to/nested/test_data/*/*' \
    ...
