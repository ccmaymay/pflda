"brightside" is a codebase implementing online variational inference
for forest-structured (Bayesian nonparametric) topic models.  It also
contains some utilities concerning geo-tagged Twitter data, ALNC, and
Freebase.

Currently two observational models, M0 and M1, are implemented.  M0 is
the nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) topic model from the
literature.[1]  M1 is a personalized topic model, based on M0, in which
each user draws a topic tree from the global tree, each document is a
path from a user's tree, and each token is drawn from a topic along the
corresponding document's path.  See notes/ for technical details.

The inference code is based on onlinehdp[2], which was in turn based on
onlinelda[3], according to comments in the onlinehdp source.

Dependencies (in addition to pylowl dependencies):
* numpy and scipy
* d3, for visualization (v3, included with source)
* a web browser supporting javascript, for visualization
* python-concrete and python-thrift (3.3pre)

To get up and running quickly, build littleowl with brightside included
and invoke src/pylowl/proj/brightside/m0/run_src.py to train on the
littleowl source tree.  From the littleowl repository root:

$ python setup.py build --with-proj-brightside
$ export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7:$PYTHONPATH"
$ export PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1
$ pushd src/pylowl/proj/brightside/m0
$ python run_src.py
$ popd

run_src.py is short---I suggest reading it.  At a high level, it
creates a toy concrete dataset from the source tree, runs M0 for a
few minute, does all postprocessing needed for visualization, and
symlinks the visualization code to the M0 model output directory.
When it's done, all that stands between you and a colorful topic
tree is a web server.

You can see command-line arguments for learning parameters, etc. with:
$ python -m pylowl.proj.brightside.m0.run -h
