In this project you'll find online variational inference for the
nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP, M0), among other things.
The nHDP source is based on onlinehdp[1], which was in turn based on
onlinelda[2], according to comments in the onlinehdp source.
It has been thoroughly hacked up.

demo.sh has a few comments---I suggest reading it.  At a high level, it
builds littleowl with brightside, creates a toy concrete dataset from
the source tree, runs M0 for a minute, and does all postprocessing
needed for visualization.  When it's done, all that stands between you
and an underwhelming topic tree is a web server.

demo.sh should have all the steps you need to get going on real data.
Note that concrete support is built in now, but you do need to
extract a vocabulary mapping beforehand.  (This is demonstrated in
demo.sh.  The zeroes are indices for section segmentation, sentence
segmentation, and tokenization list.)  Also, we assume the data has
already been divided into training and testing sets, and that all
preprocessing has been performed.

You can see command-line arguments for learning parameters, etc. with:
$ python -m pylowl.proj.brightside.run_m0 -h
(from the repository root, after doing:
$ export PYTHONPATH="build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7:$PYTHONPATH"
or something similar)

The data specifications are glob patterns so you'll end up doing
something like:
$ python -m pylowl.proj.brightside.run_m0 --data_path='/path/to/nested/data/*/*' --test_data_path='/path/to/nested/test_data/*/*' ...
(note the quotes)
